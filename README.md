## Development Environment

### Docker Environment File

The `docker-compose.yml` file will look for a file called `.env` for all environment variables. Here is an example of what the `.env` file contents look like at this moment.

```env
CONNECTION_STRING=Server=azurlaneapi-db;Database=azurlaneapi;User=root
ASPNETCORE_Environment=Development
SIGNING_KEY=MySuperSecretSigningKey
```
